# Variables for the 'local' group
# Apply to all hosts in the [local] group (currently: localhost)
#
# Discovery:
#   ansible-inventory --graph local       # See hosts in this group
#   ansible-inventory --host localhost    # See merged variables
#   ls inventory/group_vars/              # See all group_vars files
#
# Variable precedence:
#   - group_vars/all.yml applies to ALL hosts
#   - group_vars/local.yml applies only to 'local' group (this file)
#   - host_vars/<host>.yml overrides both for a specific host

# Example variables for local development:
# local_dev_mode: true
# ansible_become: false    # No sudo needed for local
