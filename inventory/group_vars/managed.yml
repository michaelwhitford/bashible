# Variables for the 'managed' group
# Apply to all hosts in the managed group (localhost + server)
#
# Discovery:
#   ./wrap-venv ansible-inventory --graph managed     # See hosts in this group
#   ./wrap-venv ansible managed -m ping               # Test all hosts in group
#   ./wrap-venv ansible managed -m debug -a "var=managed_env"  # Check this variable
#
# This demonstrates how group_vars work:
#   - All hosts in 'managed' group share these variables
#   - Override per-host in host_vars/<hostname>.yml
